    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Sincronizadas are quesadillas made with ham and cheese. They were a common
      light meal in the part of Mexico where I stayed this year and make a quick
      and easy breakfast or lunch. Serve with your favorite salsa or canned
      chile slices.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="info">
      <li>2 (8 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1/4 cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>2 slices ham</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="info">
      <li>
        Warm a griddle or a flat pan over medium heat. Sprinkle 1/2 of the
        Monterey Jack cheese over 1 of the tortillas, add ham, and sprinkle the
        rest of the cheese over the ham. Top with the second tortilla.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook sincronizada on the griddle or flat pan until tortillas are lightly
        toasted and the cheese has melted, turning with a spatula or tongs to
        toast both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side.
