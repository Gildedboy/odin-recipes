    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="info">
      Your trusty air fryer is the key to these perfect potato wedges: They're
      crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and absolutely irresistible.
      This top-rated recipe for air-fried potato wedges is one you'll come back
      to again and again.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      Opt for a starchy potato variety, such as russet potatoes or Yukon Golds,
      for perfect results. Avoid waxy potatoes, such as fingerlings, as they
      won't hold up as well during cooking.
    </p>
    <p class="info">
      You'll find the full recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you
      can expect: Seasoned potato wedges are placed in the basket of an air
      fryer and cooked for 10 minutes. The wedges are flipped with tongs and
      cooked for an additional five minutes, to ensure maximum crispiness. This
      recipe doesn't require pre-soaking the potato wedges before air frying.
      However, if you have time to soak the potatoes in cold water for about 30
      minutes before seasoning and "frying," the recipe might yield even
      crispier results.
