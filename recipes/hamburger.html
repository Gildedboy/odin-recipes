    <h1>Hamburger</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      When it's too cold to grill and you're craving a juicy burger, use your
      air fryer! The butter and bouillon mixture gives the patties a dark
      grilled color and deep beefy flavor. Add your favorite seasonings, if
      desired, but these are delicious as is! If you'd like to add cheese, turn
      off the air fryer once the patties are done and let the residual heat melt
      the cheese. Make sure you use cold meat, straight from the fridge, for
      best results.
